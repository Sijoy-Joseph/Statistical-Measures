House Price Data Analysis: Outlier Detection and Normalization
Project Overview
This project analyzes a dataset containing property prices in the city of Bangalore, focusing on detecting outliers in the price_per_sqft column and checking the normality of the data. Various methods are used to identify and handle outliers, followed by transformation techniques to make the data more normally distributed. The analysis also includes correlation analysis between numerical variables, and visualizations like box plots and scatter plots are created to support the findings.

Dataset
The dataset, house_price.csv, contains the following columns (you may need to replace with actual column names from your dataset):

price_per_sqft: The price per square foot of a property.
Other relevant numerical and categorical columns related to the properties.
Objective
Q1: Perform basic Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
Q2: Detect and remove outliers using various methods like:
Mean and Standard Deviation method.
Percentile method.
IQR (Interquartile Range) method.
Z-Score method.
Q3: Create a box plot to determine which outlier detection method works best.
Q4: Draw a histogram to check the normality of the price_per_sqft column, perform transformations if necessary, and analyze skewness and kurtosis before and after transformation.
Q5: Check the correlation between numerical columns and plot a heatmap.
Q6: Draw scatter plots to check correlations between variables.
